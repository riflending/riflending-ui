# Security and Audits

**rLending** is a decentralized investment and finance (*DEFI*) platform that takes advantage on **Bitcoin**'s stability and the **RSK ecosystem** to allow users to invest in a safe way.
**rLenbding** is bases upon our own core [*Smart Contracts*](https://github.com/riflending/rlending-protocol) which originated forked from (Compound)[https://compound.finance] and built up on key features that were later audited.
