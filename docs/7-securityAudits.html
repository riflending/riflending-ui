<p><strong>rLending</strong> is a decentralized investment and finance (<em>DEFI</em>) platform that takes advantage on <strong>Bitcoin</strong>&#39;s stability and the <strong>RSK ecosystem</strong> to allow users to invest in a safe way.
<strong>rLenbding</strong> is bases upon our own core <a href="https://github.com/riflending/rlending-protocol"><em>Smart Contracts</em></a> which originated forked from (Compound)[<a href="https://compound.finance">https://compound.finance</a>] and built up on key features that were later audited.</p>
<p><strong>rLending</strong> started with partially decentralized control of the protocol (such as choosing the interest rate model per asset). The protocol is protected by a multi-signature smart contract, requiring the agreement of several accounts in order to perform changes to the protocol.</p>
<p>The following rights in the protocol are controlled by the Multi-sig smart contract:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to list a new cToken market</li>
<li>The ability to update the interest rate model per market</li>
<li>The ability to update the oracle or any adapter address</li>
<li>The ability to withdraw the reserve of a cToken</li>
<li>The ability to update the Comptroller contract</li>
<li>The ability to choose a new admin</li>
</ul>
