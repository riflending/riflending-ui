# Introduction

**rLending** is a decentralized investment and finance (*DEFI*) platform that takes advantage on **Bitcoin**'s stability and the **RSK ecosystem** to allow users to invest in a safe way.
**rLenbding** is bases upon our own core [*Smart Contracts*](https://github.com/riflending/rlending-protocol) which form an algorithmic distributed protocol deployed on the RSK network.

Our main motivation is to allow users to lend crypto assets as collateral and to borrow them based on interest rates set by real-time supply and demand.

**In other words: Lenders earn revenue in exchange for their supplied assets and borrowers pay interests for the assets they used.**

In this pages we'll guide you through some of the basic features you will most likely be interested in using.
