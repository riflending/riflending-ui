<p><strong>rLending</strong> is a decentralized investment and finance (<em>DEFI</em>) platform that takes advantage on <strong>Bitcoin</strong>&#39;s stability and the <strong>RSK ecosystem</strong> to allow users to invest in a safe way.
<strong>rLenbding</strong> is bases upon our own core <a href="https://github.com/riflending/rlending-protocol"><em>Smart Contracts</em></a> which form an algorithmic distributed protocol deployed on the RSK network.</p>
<p>Our main motivation is to allow users to lend crypto assets as collateral and to borrow them based on interest rates set by real-time supply and demand.</p>
<p><strong>In other words: Lenders earn revenue in exchange for their supplied assets and borrowers pay interests for the assets they used.</strong></p>
<p>In this pages we&#39;ll guide you through some of the basic features you will most likely be interested in using.</p>
