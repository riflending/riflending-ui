        <h2>Residents of the European Economic Area</h2>
        <p>
          If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have certain rights and

        </p>
        <h3>Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
        <p>
          If you are a resident of the EEA, when we process your personal data we will only do so in

          responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., providing the rLending services you
          have requested). We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data. For
          example, we may process your personal data to send you marketing communications, to
          communicate with you about changes to our Services, and to provide, secure, and improve
          our Services. You have consented to the processing of your personal data for one or more
          specific purposes.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Subject Requests</h3>
        <p>
          If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the right to access personal data we hold about
          you and to ask that your personal data be corrected, erased, or transferred. You may also
          have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing. If you would
          like to exercise any of these rights, you can contact us as indicated below.
        </p>
        <h3>Questions or Complaints</h3>
        <p>
          If you are a resident of the EEA and have a concern about our processing of personal data
          that we are not able to resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data
          privacy authority where you reside. For contact details of your local Data Protection
