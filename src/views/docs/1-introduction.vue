          <p>
            <strong>rLending</strong> is a decentralized investment and finance (<em>DEFI</em>)
            platform that takes advantage on <strong>Bitcoin</strong>&#39;s stability and the
            <strong>RSK ecosystem</strong> to allow users to invest in a safe way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>rLenbding-protocol</strong> is based upon our own core of
            <a href="https://github.com/riflending/rlending-protocol"><em>Smart Contracts</em></a>
            which form an algorithmic distributed protocol deployed on the RSK network. This
            protocol defines pools of assets with algorithmically derived interest rates, based on
            the supply and demand for the assets. Suppliers (and borrowers) of an asset interact
            directly with the protocol, earning (and paying) a floating interest rate, without
            having to negotiate terms such as maturity, interest rate or collateral with a peer or
            counterparty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our main motivation is to allow users to lend crypto assets as collateral and to borrow
            them based on interest rates set by real-time supply and demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words:
            <strong
              >Lenders earn revenue in exchange for their supplied assets and borrowers pay
              interests for the assets they used.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            In this pages we&#39;ll guide you through some of the basic features you will most
            likely be interested in using.
