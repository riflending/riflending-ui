          <h2 id="whatIs">What exactly is rLending?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>rLending</strong> is a decentralized investment and finance (<em>DEFI</em>)
            platform. This means there is no central bank or government authority imposing rules on
            how to operate. Instead, the platform was designed to be completely open and
            self-regulating. This was achieved by programming the protocol with distributed
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract">Smart Contracts</a> deployed on
            the <a href="">RSK Network</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our main motivation is to allow users to lend crypto assets as collateral and to borrow
            them based on interest rates set by real-time supply and demand.
          </p>
          <h2 id="canTrade">Is rLending a Distributed Exchange (DEX)?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>No.</strong> <em>Distributed Exchanges</em> allow users to exchange one
            cryptocurrency for another. On the other hand, at a high level, rLending is a financial
            permissionless lending system built on the <a href="https://www.rsk.co">RSK Network</a>.
            rLending enables users to lend and borrow popular cryptocurrencies like
            <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/">USDT</a> in exchange for interest
            or debt.
          </p>
          <h2 id="howWorks">How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
            rLending leverages <a href="audit"> audited</a>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract">Smart Contracts</a> which are
            responsible for the storage, management and facilitation of all funds. This means that
            users do not have a rLending login, but rather connect to the
            <a href="https://www.rsk.co">RSK Network</a> and its benefits through web3 wallets.
            rLending Markets are always on, meaning that anyone can lend or borrow their assets in
            minutes without any intervention or permission request, since the
            <em>Smart Contracts</em> are self-regulating.
